# Writing Accessories Project

**Overview**:

This project demonstrates the implementation of a hierarchy for various writing accessories such as pens, pencils, markers, and highlighters. It showcases the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and composition.

**Features**
- *Polymorphism*: The project uses polymorphism to allow different types of writing accessories to be used interchangeably.

- *Encapsulation*: The details of each writing accessory are encapsulated within their respective classes.

- *Inheritance*: A base class WritingAccessory is inherited by several derived classes (Pen, Pencil, Marker, Highlighter), each providing specific - implementations of the writing and refilling behaviors.

- *Composition*: A Document class is used to manage writing accessories, demonstrating composition by including a writing accessory as a member.
